#entropy
#python shuffle
#rc4 #7 bits

this was a really fun one. Hard to notice bug
rc4 used here uses 128 bytes of state (0 - 127)
what this does is guarantees, the msb to be 0

the shuffle function, shuffles the flag bits and then a xor
is done with the output of the prng. 

If the msb of a byte is 1,
    the flag bit must be one. And vice verse.
