Complex Numbers
DoT Product


We can solve this by using LLL, or a bit of brain
the server accepts integers upto, 400 bits and hidden vector is composed of six 64 bits integers...
so, we send powers of 2, 64 bits apart and get the flag!

my v2, [2^398,2^334,2^270,2^206,2^142,2^78], and we can easily take out the bits of the hidden
number from the result!
