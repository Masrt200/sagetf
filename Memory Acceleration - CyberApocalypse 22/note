a custom made hash function which
totally didn't have any relation with some Chaotic Hash Function
or some funky equations with AES sbox!

this was really simple, if we dared to use z3!
the left shift do cancel out, if we think about it~~
putting the second loop as constraints in z3, did all the job! :)

do remember, z3 right shift is arithmetic and not logical!!!
actually same is the case from python too!
