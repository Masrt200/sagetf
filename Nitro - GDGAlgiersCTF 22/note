affine transformation...
the flag was this, CyberErudites{_NTRU_LLL_4tt4ck_}

duh, it was NTRU Encryption

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTRUEncrypt
listed are a ton of attacks,
including Lattice Reduction, Meet-in-the-middle, chosen-ciphertext

I just implemented the worst one!

It worked, since the params were very small!

so, yea straightforward NTRU!!
