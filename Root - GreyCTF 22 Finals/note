constant term of a Polynomial is the product of ALL its roots

Polynomial Recovery!!

so, yea... just send in 0 -> we get the constant term
factor it, and luckily we have 4 factors
send them and get the flag!!!

This great writeup also mentions a method by which we can recover the ENTIRE polynomial
by supplying a very large input
