attack on ECDSA nonce
middle bits of the nonce (k) was leaked
research shows even a single bit of leaked nonce can help recover the private key!
given enough samples...

here we had only two but with more than 128 bits of the nonce!
using Extended HNP and in turn LLL and all the lattice based techniques
matrix reduction was done to obtain the private key!!!
